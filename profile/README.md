# MineKingBot
This is the GitHub account for the MineKingBot project. We host the source code of all related things here, tho the most repositories are not public (yet).

## Text
A repository that is pubilc is the [one that holds all texts related to the bot](https://github.com/orgs/MineKingBot/Text). These are the messages that the bot will send on certain events. If you find any speeling or translation mistaks feel free to [fork the repository](https://github.com/MineKingBot/Text/fork) and fix the mistakes there. 
After that you can [create a pull request](https://github.com/MineKingBot/Text/compare) to merge your changes into the actual bot. <br>
The next MineKingBot update will then include your changes!

## Source Code
We do currently not provide the source code of the MineKingBot to the public but we are thinking about doing so! <br>
What we can tell you however is that the MineKingBot is written entirely using java using the libraries [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA), [DiscordUtils](https://github.com/MineKingBot/DiscordUtils), [AudioLink](https://github.com/MineKing9534/AudioLinkClient) and many more! <br>
You can find a full list of dependencies in the help page of the bot (`/help target:dependencies`). 

## Our other projects
To make it easy to use some of the MineKingBot's infrastructure in other projects, some parts were extracted to their own repositories. The projects [DiscordUtils](https://github.com/MineKingBot/DiscordUtils), [AudioLinkClient](https://github.com/MineKing9534/AudioLinkClient) as well es the [AudioLinkServer](https://github.com/MineKing9534/AudioLinkServer) implementation [the MineKingBot uses](https://github.com/MineKingBot/MKB-AudioLinkServer) are open source. If you find any issues in them or want to improve something, feel free to do so!

## Issues and Feature reqests
We have a dedicated [repository for community interactions](https://github.com/MineKingBot/MineKingBot). In the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/MineKingBot/MineKingBot/discussions) you can bring in your ideas or tell us problems you have in the [Issues tab](https://github.com/MineKingBot/MineKingBot/issues). <br>
